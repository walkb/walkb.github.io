# Walker's Old Portfolio
Hi! I'm Walker, a CS student at the University of Michigan.

This was a work in progress of a tetr.io (a battle royale version of Tetris I used to play a lot) inspired portfolio.

I am no longer planning on finishing this iteration of portfolio, as it uses pure JavaScript rather than a modern framework, which I believe would be more valuable to my skills as a developer in the future.
(I'm planning on working on this more once I gain more experience in my class!)

Feel free to click around, but if you would like a preview of my next iteration of portfolio, please go to walkerbroadbent.com. :)
