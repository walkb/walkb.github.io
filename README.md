# Walker's Portfolio
Hi! I'm Walker, a CS student at the University of Michigan.

This is a work in progress of a tetr.io (a battle royale version of Tetris I used to play a lot) inspired portfolio.

I'm planning on working on this more once I gain more experience in my class!

Feel free to click around.
