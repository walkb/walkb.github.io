# Legacy Tetr.io Portfolio
Hi, my name's Walker. This repository holds the remnants of what was the beginnings of my *very first* website.

It was heavily inspired by Tetr.io, the battle royale Tetris game. 

## 🔧 Features
- Responsive and interactiveness
- Tetrio-inspired design + interactions
- Smooth animations

##🕹️ Why It’s Still Here
It's a tribute to where I truly started on my own journey. 
At this time, I didn't know any better so I was trying to populate the website with strange methods and whatnot 
(I had just started learning about data structures at the time, which definitely did not help me in organizing anything anyway!)
